## Additional Information
The Sports Application is a Python-based tool for sports data analysis,
featuring help file generation with Sphinx and a Windows installer. 
The main code is in directories like `league/`, `player/`, and `team/`,
with docs in `source/` and builds in `build/`. Run `make html` or 
`make.bat html` to build docs, and use the installer in the `installer/` 
folder to install. Launch the app with `sports_application.exe` 
and check the docs for usage.
